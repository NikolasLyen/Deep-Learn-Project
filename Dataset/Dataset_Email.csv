I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of ""Generation X"". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed ""Baby Boomers"", it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled ""Generation X"", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows: ""We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called ""Xer's"" simply because we represent something negative to our elders.

""Ghetto"" America is a society of individuals comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""Black America;"" Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young ""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know that many young African American women refuse to date African American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as ""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also,",1,1,authentic,0327.5df76bb4359800b5408821285677b5cf

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles. Each day in the cafeteria, I walked from table to table ... Stealing other kids' lunch money. No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal. ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said, ""and I'll bring you five dollars next week."" The investment was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes. Of course when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash, I promised to pay them even more the week after that, if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer. Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties, and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money. I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid, and I didn't even get beat up. Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn. First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you're ahead. Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket. Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money, not yours. The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and money managers, will always tell you that the best tim",1,1,authentic,0260.737eefb83e7eedbd531117c273c56241

At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers.

Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money. And they expect you to listen to them? Enough. If you want to make money with your computer, then you should hook up with a group that is actually DOING it. We are making a large, continuing income every month. What's more - we will show YOU how to do the same thing. This business is done completely by internet and email, and you can even join for free to check it out first. If you can send an email, you can do this. No special ""skills"" are required. How much are we making? Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month. We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time. But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work, and rake in the cash. That kind of job does not exist. But if you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be just the thing you are looking for. This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is done FOR you - it is all based on your effort. But, as I said, there are no special skills required. And this income is RESIDUAL - meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase each month also). Interested? I invite you to find out more. You can get in as a free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you decide it is not for you.

I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell. I need those houses... Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV. (And of course you get your full commission.) I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not.

My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target. Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next of kin to my father. But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money.

ATTN:, First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries. We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment. I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner. We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus aft",1,1,authentic,0372.216f90ef52558ed24402e192586a40e8

Dear Sir, I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a se",1,0,authentic,0476.0530ef1b33305fdf919489946570685b

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel - the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose either. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'. You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another miracle diet pill!"" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, so I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing to lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was the best decision I've ever made. PERIOD. Six months later, as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet at all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it! I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health. I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus' absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED! If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having any success, and just not getting the results you were promised, then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

Of course it does. You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles. ""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my husband earns in a year"". The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet.

This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever dream. Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time ""mesh-enabled"" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying traffic for everyone else.

It naturally spiked startup time and window time slightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla's no tolerance policy for regressions. While this ""line in the sand"" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it misses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to add features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see features removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, relying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the user interface is now full of 3000 menu items?

The resulting computers are sent to the developing world for activist use. For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a day's wage for most of the population. The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any international shipping duties on the computers.

From past results, what's needed are one or more of the below: A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves, with variation on a per-original score basis; ideally, allow for having ""correlated"" mutations - in other words, have a mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the ""Evolutionary Strategies"" of Schwefel; B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a fifth of the new ""individuals"" are doing about as well as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate more parameters; if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate l",0,1,authentic,1594.f552f47fa01a4ca29e34182de6f0cca7

My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that the supposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absolute terms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noise floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last 50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate of temperature change. People unfamiliar with history of global temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree here or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that global temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity. I therefore immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why temperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the last couple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geological standards). This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use climate to push a particular social agenda. It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers paved over their civilization.

I recognize that freshrpms.net packages are designed with standard Red Hat in mind, including a standard kernel RPM. However, I hope that Matthias will consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation. The diff is attached below. The first part of the diff contains a conditional that checks to see if the expected RPM is installed. If it is, %{karch} is set as before and a new %{krpm} flag is set to 1. If the expected RPM is not installed, then %{karch} is instead set using ""uname -p"", while %{krpm} is left undefined. The second part of the diff is simpler. We only require that kernel-source be installed if the kernel itself came from an RPM. (If the kernel was hand-built, the presumably the user knows enough to have retained the sources in the expected place.) Again, I realize that I'm operating ""off warrantee"" by not using a Red Hat kernel RPM. Matthias, if you think this tweak is reasonable and not too ugly, I'd love to see you pick it up.

Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow. I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though, to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor files. So I have just added ""-home /etc/razor"" as an argument. I haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.) At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes? Is there, perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes? Any ideas would be welcome. Thanks, Joe --- Joe Berry jo",0,1,authentic,1650.3d76995e778ef56fcf4ff76b02d485ed

He was arrested in Wrexham in the early hours of August 16 when officers traced the call to a phone box on the town's Brook Street. The 45-year-old, of Queensway, Hope, near Wrexham, has pleaded guilty to one count of wasting police time on August 15 this year. The court was told Youde claimed to have no recollection of making the calls having been drinking all day. Defence lawyer Mark Arden says the offence was neither premeditated nor calculated but added that this was no excuse. He said: ""What he's done is horrific. It's unforgivable. The distress he's caused the families is unacceptable."" Youde has been released on unconditional bail until November 7 when he will be sentenced.

The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team. RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer, said: ""Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long."" Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner because it has not been reported missing. Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length.

You can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine. This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list) http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks, even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine. The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next.

More details about these are at http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/ None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O. POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most proprietary Unixes implement. The Linux kernel hackers are currently rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too. It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base. People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but apparently some don't, so I'll rebut. Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the original stupid errors.

It's more enjoyable than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers! 5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and leaving you with a feeling of well-being. 6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called pheromones. These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy! 7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world.

That's a steppe too far (Filed: 28/08/2002) So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham or sick of Sheffield. Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad. Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to emigrate to provincial Russia. After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other side. ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant. ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are becoming 'traditionally' relaxed."" The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour. It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also opening time in the nation's vodka shops. And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that ""the money a Br",0,0,authentic,0222.160c5b2e2a80f71367b4d9a47f8f9d4e

All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the private APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have updated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first place. But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly exclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change. But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of ""known"" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it is not allowed to load.

This will go someplace interesting. I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other words, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful. At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all advocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when I did the 2.0 spec.

We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince him. After it was clear that wouldn't work, we threatened to bomb them and begun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned to invade two months before the attacks. While it's not clear they knew about 9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. Three days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline Karzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work for the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline rather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable because it's too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. Bin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn't carry them out. It's far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, carried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have gone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone after Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect opportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize Afghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever.

As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I really think I'm going to pick this up. That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively high- speed ""GPRS"" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice time is another story -- more on that later.) Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing hybrids focus on ""enterprise"" customers -- the big businesses that are supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their own words, ""Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to 34-year-old demographic.""

I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins, and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and maybe me and you, too. But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic proto-warriors in the background. You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white.

The incident illustrates how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to those of the Fhrer. Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the present Chancellor, said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union headquarters in Ingolstadt. Chancellor Schrder is doing nothing to stop the flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland, said the letter, signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. Many thanks for your nice thoughts, replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for membership. The letter used chunks of Hitlers book, which is still banned in Germany. History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries. The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive, the letter-writer said.

I limped along in the default Gnome desktop, I had a few unsuccessful stabs at the Solaris open view desktop, but nothing really stuck. Because of this along with SGI's love of pre-configured, pre-compiled freeware[1], I never really made the jump from Irix to Linux either. After installing the enlightenment WM, I have to say, I am really enlightened. It's definitely a far cry from the no frills first look from previous versions. It's only on version 0.17,[2] but it's a careful balance between simplicity, performance, (fun) features, applications, and ease of customization.

Make yourself sexier. At least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a woman mayor at that. Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace. They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her clothes back on. But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they wanted to keep their men. ""The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some sun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays. There's nothing we can do,"" Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.

The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data.

I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me (or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1]. I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0: _Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._ Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing wrong, and they don't listen. Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]?

Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages rather than to the first unseen in the current folder. Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.

I have to admit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, ""Do you really agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!"" Do I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of course not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in mind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily agreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas regarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is an issue that needs to be addressed. That's something. To cover the list specifically: - Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's proposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is painfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem. - Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the useless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain speed. - Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, slow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's top usability problem. - Message ",0,1,authentic,2038.326b26998e0dcc010ec7f808225903e8

It took two hours to find her. ""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I knew then there was something special."" Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan, who is expecting their first child. Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand in search of a wife. ""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring."" Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in touch with Wan by phone and mail.

The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content. While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer risk to humans. ""It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental exposure levels"" as well, the report said.

In recent years, scientific research has suggested that people who have strong friendships experience less stress, they recover more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible to the common cold, studies show. But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie, insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. ""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy, envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford, advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside. ""There's this myth that friendships should last a lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that they end.""

Perhaps we look at the sequences file more than once per message view? Just idle speculation - we can stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are. Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log. We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 - Tcl has had ""clock seconds"" (like gettimeofday) and ""clock clicks"" (high resolution timer) for some time. But in 8.3 we've calibrated clock clicks values to microseconds. It is still only useful for relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond delta since the last log record. Of course, we are measuring all the overhead of taking the log record, etc. I'll try it out.",0,0,authentic,1047.816db4421a9757ddbb0acbe7baecd0b0

The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and building materials. The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a species called cryptostigma. Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey. The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees scrape off and use for their nest. Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in bees. Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: ""In turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection."" Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further research on how they tend to their herd. Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

The one I gave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail). bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server to be scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server for delivery. As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10 before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available. But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10 never goes down. Why?

Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48, has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at virtually no cost. The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the exercise industry. ""I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,"" is the opening paragraph penned by Bronson. ""Its a joke and a big con and they call me a criminal!"" You cant help feeling he has a point.

Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington, D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic X-ray sources.'' Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other half of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of the University of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from the sun by the billion. Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine. In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South Dakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion. Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino detector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of the brightest objects in the universe.

Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do with Dr. Rajcoomar. Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza. They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident, already scary, could - and should - have ended there.

Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of copyrighted works. ""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same conference panel. I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to initiate becaus",0,1,authentic,0108.e6e9cb097a3b5e37d94a7ff29bc4412a

Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big, vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday, including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping, founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from the public has been fantastic, Mr Bamping said. Big cats in Britain are real. They are out there, they are breeding; theres more of them. Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark Fraser, who heads the societys Scottish arm, said: Lynx are now present in the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I dont want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders. Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and ",0,0,authentic,0228.b83f2f4ef114c69d9ca927d1082b393f

Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine, contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month. Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf. Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise. As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes. Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back, was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises. Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten.

The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages spoken in Namibia. Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which translates roughly as ""let's have intercourse"" in the Oshiwambo language. It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from the femidon - female condom - as jewellery. According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist. He intended it to mean ""you will see for yourselves"" in the Siyeyi tongue. One caller said the complainants ""should be considerate of other people's languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo"". Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in Siyeyi means testicles. Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have intercourse.

(Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments, but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.) 1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of 'internet keys' wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll wheel. Also, hibernate that works, please. 1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones) in BIOS, please. 2- P4 Dells overheat. They have a big heatsink and a little fan to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on. Not good for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you've got an angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)

A couple of intellectuals have pointed out parallels between the rigidity of OS X, which derives its power from Unix and XML, and the rules of standards-based web development, which also compels you to do things the right way instead of using five different non-standard hacks. The parallel is not without merit. Building web pages the right way is hard at first, but once you get it, you never want to go back.

I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem. I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18. I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driver for it. Minicom is very much able to dial out. But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation. When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial info of my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal. Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat. I used this command: pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script somewhere). It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection is established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits. This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial port using pppd to connect ttyS0. I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited. Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of having to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to Linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc. It'd be nice never have to go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).

The first day's findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.

We celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism. Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.

The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits to their power.

A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they would have had to invent it. So it is with global warming. Their fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrial civilization. The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming theorists said should be there is old news. The news here is that the temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have been validated with a different means of measurement. Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global warming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the ""Medieval Warm Period"". Said period was warmer than what we have now, and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2. In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused DIRECTLY by CO2. CO2 doesn't trap that much heat. Water vapor does, and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have your warming theory. Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate. More water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more clouds. Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great deal on how the cloud formation shakes out.

With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born. But there was something else. What would later come to be called South America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast -- which no European was known to have seen. The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed along its top. The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the curvature of the Earth. It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12 large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the world.

I just wanted to say that I am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. I sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. If I had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. However, I watch the Frontline show ""Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero"" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers. I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?). Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program. My shallow comment on Salon and others like it (my boyfriend and I had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about how some of us tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others.

Unlike competing solutions that process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, according to company officials. The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML data. According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two businesses. ""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. ""The XA35 is the first of a family."" Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best alternative.

Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: ""The penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a successful breeding season over the winter."" Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the cape, may have lost up to third of its population. ------------------------ Yahoo!

Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh. ""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London who discovered the creatures in the UK. The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species, otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likely these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental plants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay."" He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has ",0,1,authentic,0198.62d2556d8ae158aa2b1410cb82bfff59

guido@python.org (Guido van Rossum),,"Fri,06 Sep 2002 10:31:22 -0400",[Spambayes] Deployment,"Quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm, I'd like to think about deployment. Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download a spambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questions about their mail setup, training and false positives, and install it as a filter. A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can easily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to find individuals willing to risk this than postmasters). There are many ways to do this. Some ideas: - A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server. You configure it by telling it about your real pop servers. You then point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost. When it receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads your mail, and gives you only the non-spam. To train it, you'd only need to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that anything is ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours. - A server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message and that answers ""spam"" or ""ham"". Then you have a little program that is invoked e.g. by procmail that talks to the server. (The server exists so that it doesn't have to load the pickle with the scoring database for each message. I don't know how big that pickle would be, maybe loading it each time is fine. Or maybe marshalling.) - Your idea here. Takers? How is ESR's bogofilter packaged? SpamAssassin?

It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still. There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the early 1980s if not before. A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly adequate. It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition) must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes, or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not tried it on extf3 or reiser.) BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of writing to RAID4 or RAID5...

He had married an asian woman through one of these introduction services. after about a year of marriage she had charged him with assault and left him, leaving no contact information. He was hanging around in Chinatown, asking random asians for help finding her. I obviously don't know if he did assault her, but what struck me was that the possibility of mutual exploitation is high. Anecdote number two: In college I had a job as a street vendor. There was a guy I worked with who was a lifer in the job. He was a noticably messed up guy. Among other odd characteristics he fawned on women customers, doing stuff like offering them flowers. I asked him about it. He said that he'd never had sex with a woman who wasn't a prostitute, and his dream was to save up enough money to get a mail order bride. I was really moved.

It has the ring of something apocraphyl to me, but it's a good read, nevertheless. The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads were built by English expatriates. Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used. Why did ""they"" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel ruts...

After the tiffin carriers are picked up, they are taken to the nearest railway station, where they are sorted according to the destination station. At the destination station they are unloaded by other dabba wallahs and re-sorted, this time according to street address and floor. The 80 kg crates of carriers, carried on dabba wallahs' heads, hand-wagons and cycles are delivered at 12.30 p.m., picked up at 1.30 p.m., and returned when they came.

Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking for the filling to be tested. The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.

I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.

I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the database, but the database is accessible from the web application.

Hoover's South Boston ""social-club"" putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in hindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by the Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not for New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US, only makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all. The result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of Italian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone.

Rohit] In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like. The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article. Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money.

Introduced by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act would create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill is co-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.). The proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would support long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective education and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers and professionals. ""The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big step forward for this very small technology,"" Lieberman, who vowed to pushed to full Senate passage before the end of the year, said. ""Nowhere in the world are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of nanotechnology.

MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"". It is the standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the world-wide Internet email system. Typical uses of MIME include sending images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part of the file. MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message? Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use which do not understand MIME messages. However, there are a growing number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in. (One popular MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z) In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation capability in their Internet gateway products. However, even if you do not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is still hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME message. One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"". It was developed at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpac",0,1,authentic,0378.933eac5ec9a3ef912c40c6a30a11e07d

All of those who perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and, indeed, for all of us. But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers must be replaced on the site. About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost, along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity. Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15% of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding. If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as th",0,1,authentic,0777.5c0e911c29651cdea8729a23d3d5b203

More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a selectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94).

When the new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will be offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3. ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a training class for staff at the UCC computer science department. Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the Linux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish universities. The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme that aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source style of computing. The Linux distributor runs an 'educational channel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software with its operating environment and offering networked support services to eligible applicants. This scheme was originally designed to suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to schools and universities throughout the world. Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance features and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to master on personal systems.

Unlike competing solutions that process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, according to company officials. The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML data. According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two businesses. ""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. ""The XA35 is the first of a family."" Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best alternative.

New analysis of the remaining fragments shows that it was wicked-cool: The Greeks believed in an earth-centric universe and accounted for celestial bodies' motions using elaborate models based on epicycles, in which each body describes a circle (the epicycle) around a point that itself moves in a circle around the earth. Mr Wright found evidence that the Antikythera mechanism would have been able to reproduce the motions of the sun and moon accurately, using an epicyclic model devised by Hipparchus, and of the planets Mercury and Venus, using an epicyclic model derived by Apollonius of Perga. (These models, which predate the mechanism, were subsequently incorporated into the work of Claudius Ptolemy in the second century AD.) A device that just modelled the motions of the sun, moon, Mercury and Venus does not make much sense. But if an upper layer of mechanism had been built, and lost, these extra gears could have modelled the motions of the three other planets known at the timeMars, Jupiter and Saturn. In other words, the device may have been able to predict the positions of the known celestial bodies for any given date with a respectable degree of accuracy, using bronze pointers on a circular dial with the constellations of the zodiac running round its edge.

I do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand from my father. The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income. While it is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not something that was impressed upon them. The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals, typically an ""Indian Corporation"" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe). In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per person, depending on the tribe. The dividend money comes from a number of places, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and various businesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.

Consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers is now recommending that it be built in Bucharest instead. It comes after Prince Charles led international protests against the original proposals to build it in the medieval town of Sigishoara. PricewaterhouseCoopers name Bucharest, originally believed to be an outsider in the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for the project. But that has angered residents in Sigishoara, where Vlad the Impaler, the inspiration for Dracula, was born. They are counting on the park to boost the local economy. Evenimentul Zilei reports that Sigishoara was placed behind the capital with the Black Sea port of Constanta third choice. Dorin Danesan, mayor of Sigishoara, said: ""The pre-feasibility report from PWC shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located in Bucharest. But I still think that Sigishoara is the best location for it."" The park would include hotels, a Dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghost train and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around a reconstruction of Dracula's castle and an artificial lake. The project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisation Unesco fearing Sigishoara might be spoilt. PricewaterhouseCoopers is to present its final report on the project on October 15.

Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much. Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should air during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The shows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and some aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents and children wish to watch TV together during this hour. It should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television viewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then don't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because you don't like its content.

Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went fine except it didn't pick up my monitor. I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4 Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM. Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next? Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice, the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead. If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful - I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas. Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?

Rohit Khare <khare@alumni.caltech.edu>,fork@example.com,"Mon,7 Oct 2002 17:09:00 -0700",why is decentralization worth worrying about?,"Why am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of todays most profound problems with networked applications are caused by centralization. Generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid value at a time. That limits us to only representing information A) according to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more slowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the basis for todays most popular architectural style for developing network applications: client-server interaction using request-response communication protocols. I believe these are profound limitations, which we are already encountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the beholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the separate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another, unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a centralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a third example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as abstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and communication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light and human ",0,0,authentic,0977.d0e3f4e7fd0a8c2bdd26888af1ca3a0b

I am involved in porting a SCO unix application to Linux, and we have encountered a problem with the way semaphores are being handled. The application uses mulitple processes to run application code with the main process known as the bsh which controls all i/o be it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handled via semaphores. In certain circumstances the main process and the application child process seem to lock up both waiting for the syncronisation semaphores to change state, I have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that the semaphore code is doing the correct things for syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the semop() system call. I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay between changing semaphore states the problem goes away, but this causes our entire application to run really sloooww !! lol Is there anything weird or different with the standard implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could cause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state in a semaphore immediately? Setting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno == EAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails (-1) also fixes the problem but again system performance goes down the toilet. both the parent controlling process run as the same uid, and the parent creates the semaphores with permissions 0666.

Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her own cells. ""The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize dentistry,"" said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that focuses on oral and facial science.

He used to say that you never saw a runner smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, &#8220;Look, another runner... not smiling!&#8221; This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a runner. Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, then get invigorated and run another mile. And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated.

He said they were going to take a real hands off approach, so it's funny that they would blame the regulators for causing the collapse. One thing he did get right, is that he wasn't worried that the US was behind Europe in the wireless licensing spectrum. This is something very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for very little benefit. His legacy was/is supposed to be rethinking the FCC's role to stay out of the way in this period of business innovation in the wireless space as he didn't want the government forcing business models onto the private sector. His full transcript is here [1]. Interestingly enough I got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole CTIA'2001 Las Vegas keynote series of speakers. Clay and I hoped a flight out of Ontario to Las Vegas to do demo support for Craig Barrett [2]. His message was that there's no difference between wired and wireless Internet--it's all the same thing. Instead of scalable networks, we should be thinking about scalable content (& using Magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with the content scaling back for each target platform).

She also likes to have control over her environment, and this means she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting the music playing. By watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design from watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market niche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player. The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI disaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the button again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again when the music doesn't play. For toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately, within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the button multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't change the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you press, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be the same. The back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI disaster for Tatum.

The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible. It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over spending spreads the damage more evenly. Rent control would be an example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending tons of money on public housing. As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever. The opinion that EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty much anathema to liberal politics. Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private replacements, no government regulation) is better t",0,0,authentic,0822.3ebf2e0f82aa0195233b0221d665410d

Recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk. I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept mail from the new location. There seems to be a variable in exmh-defaults (bgspool). It says at the top of the file not to edit these lines. So, I went ahead and edited it :-) That does not make a difference. It seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from my spool/incoming mail area and piping it to rcvstore. So, I need to configure that probably. Any idea how I would do this?

First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart was racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head with blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general artery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the heart). Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass because of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?

I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach. Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server. A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the database, but the database is accessible from the web application. Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the database password, I can use a different database with different user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.

Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points. Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate executive or World Bank delegate. D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities were in talks to decide whether planned protests were, ""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to take proactive action."" Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next weekend. The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic blockade, banner-drops and protests against major corporations in the downtown core. Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name, told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.

Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as ""Little Chicago."" Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. ""The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,"" Jose Sandoval, author of ""Mother Aged 5,"" told Reuters.

While I appreciate the flexibility of the sequences window, the unseen window filled an important-to-me need: It was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual window manager without taking a lot of space. Since my normal mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a 1024x768 vnc session, screen space is at a premium. As things stand now, I have a sequences window that shows a lot more information than I need to have handy and takes up a lot more room than I can ""spare"". I can see that I could like the new sequences window a lot for certain operations. But I'd like a nice uncluttered, tiny window that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail. One possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse click that ""shrinks"" the Sequences window to show only the sequences in the ""always show"" list.

The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define), virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that is managed from a central console. Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after scouting some 65 companies. Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi. ""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7 or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a critical element to their N1 initiative.

The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details were immediately available. The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses. The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more secure location. ------------------------ Yahoo!

However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is somewhat simpler to setup. The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only. So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ? If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever on the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.

Their front-line customer service sucks, but the prices and network can't be beat. T-Mobile is in the midst of a massive makeover. In recent months, the company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta Jones. The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received 1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements.

The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on senses other than sight. Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter Roland Zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has been blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery and drinks. ""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can't find my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dish is -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?"" another invisible guest said. In the ""unsicht-Bar,"" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like a fish, meat or vegetarian option. ""We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and smelling,"" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and sight-restricted people, which is running the bar.

Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. End result: people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not capturing all that information. You can always ""page fault"" to get the information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine (this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be dll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be relevant.

I was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took for granted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took it just as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore XML almost completely. I attended realizing that ""content management"" is generally used to apply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked how completely out of scope document management was (almost no consideration of the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than the occasional ""...and you can use FOP to make PDF"" as if that was functional): this seems more the case in open source content management than in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier to ignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).

September 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take a superficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply because the sun still rises and sets. This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing into the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans all seen live in real time by millions the world over tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds, which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers dealt in icons the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the manifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and centering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes, they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine. Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally repugnant and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and bombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only ghoulish not fearsome.

Issue of 2002-04-01 Posted 2002-03-25 When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new people often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone suspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the Bush Administration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by a father-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believe that, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family has resumed its governance-and about time, too. The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, or worse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs. Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense and foreign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as Clinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline. Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article in Foreign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clinton of ""an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the commander in chief."" Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this Administration also served under the President's father.

Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the night. In another incident, the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman and three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to represent a Celtic god or tribal symbol. Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA) a radical alternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance admitted responsibility last night for targeting the two images. The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in 1857. But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman with a horn which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white carpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse Association, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet. John Roberts of the association said: ""It has obviously been very well organised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a horn cut out of carpets.

The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers. The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles) south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday. It had not eaten for three weeks. Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman. Garlanded One animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had failed because of the blind faith of the people. The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers. The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages, as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka. Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it around the clock. 'Exploited' Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between t",0,0,authentic,0477.b7958d4d9cb312c16965859705826a7e

The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client that combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the hyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an untrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting, permitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users machine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the user clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't vulnerable. The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser command to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will need to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual' browser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the 'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from the login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar in the buddy list window.

The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform, which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down. Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him. The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement. Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the church.

It was good; a beautiful interface that legions of 'sheep' can look at and say ""Cool; I can understand this"" and leave their shackles behind. :) I was struck by the massive amount of applications, both KDE and Gnome, intuitively seperated NOT by the Gnome/KDE names, but by their **meanings** instead. It's obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more 'international'; the web browser graphic, for example, has a 'world' icon with a mouse wrapped around it. Office-apps have familiar pens, paper, and/or calculators involved. This is a Linux that I can plop down in front of almost anyone, and they can figure it out. At some point I'd miss the character of KDE/Gnome, and I'll probably 'hotrod' the graphics setup with my own themes, etc. But for the wide release, this one's IT. If you get a chance, try this; I think you'll be surprisingly pleased. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Brian Fahrlnder Linux Zealot, Conservative, and Technomad Evansville, IN My Voyage: http://www.CounterMoon.com ICQ 5119262 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Just machines, to make big decisions- programmed by fellas with compassion and vision.

For the record, here's how it all works: * exim4.conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file /etc/exim/harvest does not exist. That is, any ""junk mail condition"" that can be detected by Exim ACLs (access control lists) is handled entirely in exim4.conf: the message is rejected before it ever gets to local_scan.py. This covers such diverse cases as ""message from known spammer"" (reject after every RCPT TO command), ""no message-id header"", and ""8-bit chars in subject"" (both rejected after the message headers/body are read). The main things I have changed in the absence of /etc/exim/harvest are: - don't check for 8-bit chars in ""From"" header -- the vast majority of hits for this test were bounces from some Asian ISP; the remaining hits should be handled by SpamAssassin - do header sender verification (ie. ensure that there's a verifiable email address in at least one of ""From"", ""Reply-to"", and ""Sender"") as late as possible, because it requires DNS lookups which can be slow (and can also make messages that should have been rejected merely be deferred, if those DNS lookups timeout) * if /etc/exim/harvest exists, then the behaviour o",0,0,authentic,1846.07f7f47e25de2b8f08cabfc5ef3e3709

When I tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding. This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch. Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?

And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the average moggy, it claims to have ""firm evidence"" that the majority are real.

In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor drivers can't unionize.

What is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction? There are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the 'MAIL FROM' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think most people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a ""permanent"" error. That pretty much means, ""Don't bother to try from that address again, you'll get the same error."" People often add cathartic messages to accompany the 550 like, ""Spammers must die."" But this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers that you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to get around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail? That is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but then just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how SpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP transaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is going fine and has no reason to try new methods. Then there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is saying ""mailbox does not exist."" This would be in the hopes that some spammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from their lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can lower the incidence.

In Betamax case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. This principle is under attack. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits distribution.

There is an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the right time, to go that high. Beyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is involved in significant wealth. Being a super-model, for example. Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models. Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school. Most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms. It is the rest of us who tend to sort. There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the first place. Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist. Sowell seems to agree at least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous. And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring? IQ? Purity of heart? Or the ability to satisfy customers? Functionally most people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart. Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the Forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door' is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition. Differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far more animosity than differences due to luck. Luck can be",0,0,authentic,0807.f71b636c06421f0cddb167eed4c0be82

Filmmakers such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously calculate compositional or edit",0,1,authentic,2310.5c05ac6e4c2b473ef5dec9fe794ec853

(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it's about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. But I digress.) If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the pro-CSS camp[1].

Well, it's crap[2]. There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim to know a lot about[7]), among others. But &#8220;because it'll future-proof your site for the next generation of mobile devices&#8221; is not one of them.

Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.

My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first get a button that reads: ""Check the signature with GnuPG"" If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring then I get a message saying just that, and the message: ""Can't check signature: public key not found"" along with a button with the inscription ""Query keyserver"" If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs. Forever. If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it must be the code that goes out to the keyserver. Anyone else with this problem?

I was wondering if anyone else has received such a call? I am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or whether the open source/community aspect of the razor project is going by the wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach (ala brightmail and the likes).

Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley in just four weeks. Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security cameras captured it on film. The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body. He said: ""It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of a hunter. ""It looked at me calmly before moving on."" The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news of the sighting. His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images of the large cat prowling through their garden. She said: ""I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate for it to get hurt."" Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden",0,1,authentic,0348.3b405d7ce51b88004e6106862f9e3ac4

Use the dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. *Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was",0,1,authentic,2455.a8172ce70c990c52ba73c2f2cb17b5f2

The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good condition and believed to be hundreds of years old. They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh. The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became overgrown.

''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago, when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said. Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the temple to take care of them. ''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of Kampong Thom province. ''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''

Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980. It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from Attica state prison. At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the ex-Beatle. Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star. Shot dead Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New York City apartment on 8 December 1980. He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice. Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him. The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him before the shooting. 'Deserved death' Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his crime.

I think that there are a couple of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix their systems, is almost passed over. I know that you know this, and you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others. There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available vulnerability code. I can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites. Doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions. I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort. And the security admin's job would be a lot harder.

For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, Windows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so I ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already made. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll write more about what I learned. One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to have someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper right hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently infested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.

Greg Reuters Market News Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET By Peter Henderson SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1. It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals making computers which manage networks. EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break. ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever needed.

Most are thrown away or recycled after being seized as part of security measures since September 11. But an enterprising chaplain is sending them to Catholic missionaries for distribution to Third World hospitals and clinics. In theory travellers who have left nail scissors, nail files, corkscrews or manicure sets from their hand luggage can arrange for them to be returned. In practice many just shrug and leave the scissors by the X-ray scanners. Father Arturo Rossini, chaplain of Malpensa airport in Milan, said that scissors were costly or unavailable in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. He told Corriere della Sera that he had plucked up the courage to ask the authorities if he could have the confiscated scissors. With the help of a retired airport policeman, he had packaged 60,000 nail scissors and manicure sets, using the airport chapel as a packing centre. Packages were shipped in aircraft holds to Peru, Brasil, India, Mozambique, Argentina, Zambia and Kenya. In such countries, what we think of as a personal grooming accessory can be a vital tool. The idea has been taken up at other Italian airports. ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~--",0,0,authentic,0297.738b9e94deb4bf077221292f071de345

Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much interference or too many clients. Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a directional antenna either way. Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 802.11...

Seriously, diversity is something record companies can't afford anymore - not the majors, at any rate. I'd go to this article, posted at Linux Journal, which quotes a Newsweet article (July 15,2002) by Steven Levy saying ""So why are the record labels taking such a hard line? My guess is that it's all about protecting their Internet-challenged business model. Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the industry moved to a more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic shakeout in Webcasting is ""inevitable and desirable because it will bring about market consolidation."" That's really it in a nutshell. ""Market consolidation"" means the less artists they have to promote, the less ultimate dollars they'll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because that's all you'll be able to find out there.

Stuff in {}'s is my (and others) additions to the debate. My apologies if I've paraphrased anybody incorrectly, I will be glad to retract if anyone is miffed. The article makes four main points. 1) Absence of critical clauses. In this case, the idea is that the licence is invalid because it doesn't specify under what country's law the GPL is governed. 2) Specification in English only. That for the end user (as opposed to businesses), the GPL doesn't apply because it's not written in French. 3) Arbitary licence change. The point here is that (under French law) the author can change the terms of the licence arbitarily. This is because any granting of rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and times. In the absence of such limitations, the original author has the right to change his software back to closed on a whim. { David Neary makes the point that the copyright holder automatically retains the right to change the licence. Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from all *copyright holders* That's not my understanding. French law allows a GPL type licence *_on condition_* that the specific conditions of the granting of such rights are clear - if they are not, there is nothing to stop the original author taking back ""his work"".

But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed because it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury. ""I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble surface,"" she said. After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check the object for authenticity. If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for auction. She added: ""If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite."" But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of academic caution. ""Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece of extraterrestrial rock,"" he said. ""They have a very smoot",0,1,authentic,0282.fd87e7b9765004f6123ebe981bc16a1c

Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002.

I believe a suitable memorial surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways, children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives. What do you think should done with the space? Joe Adams Hillsdale, New Jersey I dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan that's designed by committee and that's gone through public hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more public space that the public hates, of which there are plenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city and that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young ambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the towers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic events occurred in New York that in any other city would be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and historical museums and in New York there's barely a little plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation. It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for their big chance, and compared to that spirit of entrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a statue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's Tomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President Grant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb and thin",0,1,authentic,0617.5b8410959a7bc173315e3d59d978ba2c

Amassed during the initial stages of a complicated insurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the confidential material contains data and expert analysis developed by some of the nation's most respected engineering minds. It includes computer calculations that have produced a series of three-dimensional images of the crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit, helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to the collapses. An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the debris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what government analysts have been able to put together as they struggle to answer the scientifically complex and emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly failures of the buildings.

Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).) My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The MUA accesses this ""eThunk"" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter) and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme. Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL's IMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If this is available, the ""simple viewer"" could be enhanced to support viewing via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would use this",0,0,authentic,1766.16e55768065036480deaa72ebb3bd8d5

Instead you should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can fail is not insignificant. Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: [IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup Screenshot)] The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might not conform to the system password policy.

ATLAS and EDWARD WONG It was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when he became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways last March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner and meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and renegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped through his files and found the number for the Texas Pacific Group, an investment firm headed by David Bonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation for fixing problem companies. Mr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines, had watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of $66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed for bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600 million. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in America West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. That search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let Texas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? asked Richard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr. Siegel reached. In June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again.

I've got a USR 56K Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side, but the modem handshake always fails at this speed. The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to ~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps. Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows worked first time(!?), any ideas? Baud 1200 7 data bits Even Parity I am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string: AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1 ... which is most of the defaults. USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) & set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2) But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving up. btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their modems may be difficult.

Unfortunately, these countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users."" Offshore usability is a specific case of the general ""offshore design"" problem. Put simply, software teams are not successful when design or management are done in a different physical location than programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 development every day.

This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _ over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) Robb Beal wrote[4]: ""Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's a Mac application a net plus? (No.)"" Well _duh_. Your product would have to appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same amount of money.

They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used to violate copyrights. Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing.

The executive director of the World Food Programme, James Morris, said Zimbabwe's decision would send an important message to other countries in the region which have refused food aid because it might contain GM grain. Until now, Zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute ground maize to allay fears that GM grain could be planted. But a Zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system of checks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco-system. There have been fears that Southern African nations could lose lucrative export markets in Europe if they cannot certify that their crops are GM-free. Aid Mr Morris announced the policy reversal after talks in Harare with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.

The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible. It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over spending spreads the damage more evenly. Rent control would be an example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending tons of money on public housing. As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever. The opinion that EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty much anathema to liberal politics. Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private replacements, no government regulation) is better than government regulation itself.

It is from this heritage that we can trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more commonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files from that user's Sites directory within their home directory.

As several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used to be the #1 ""mark""[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and Google bombing[3]. Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for ""go to hell"" [4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for ""talentless hack""[6] no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work putting together a usable and useful site).

Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All October 2, 2002 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN Apparently it fell into the category ""too good to check."" Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that the World Health Organization had found in a study that blonds would become extinct within 200 years, because blondness was caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The reports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News program ""Good Morning America,"" and on Saturday by CNN. There was only one problem, the health organization said in a statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds would become extinct, and it had never done a study on the subject. ""W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports originated,"" said the organization, an agency of the United Nations based in Geneva, ""but would like to stress that we have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."" All the news reports, in Britain and the United States, cited a study from the World Health Organization - ""a blonde-shell study,"" as The Daily Star of London put it.",0,1,authentic,0927.3fda95ccbe3f7818f1dfebfddeb2af66

No president since James Madison, nearly 200 years ago, has seen the nations capital city successfully attacked. But, one year ago, President George W. Bush was thrown into the first great crisis of the 21st century. This is the presidents story of September 11th and the week America went to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air Force One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, the president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he remembers Sept. 11. I knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for some around the world to forget the mission, but not me, Mr. Bush says during the Air Force One interview. Not me. I made the pledge to myself and to people that Im not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So long as Im president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to justice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives. The memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first hours after the attack. Not since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane been so central to America in a crisis. For President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine.

The effects are a complete disaster. There are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid. So almost all the literature talks about that. But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation. The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.

The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday. Each time Kamuniak, whose name means ""the blessed one"" in the local Samburu tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed the natural mothers to feed them. Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by their natural mothers. The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (""taken by force""), was adopted at the weekend. ""She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony,"" said Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden. Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a distance. Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants to be loved. ------------------------ Yahoo!

It now appears in Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked together and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs. The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth. The definitive work on dragons is ""The Flight of Dragons"" by Peter Dickinson.

A war with Iraq could really kill 'em: While aggressively adding attractions, Disney boosted its profit by steadily raising admission prices. The strategy worked, helping deliver record profit for Disney year after year. ""The strategy was build, build, build. Every year there was something new,"" said David Koenig, a Disney historian and author. ""It was an astounding growth period.... Now they're overexposed.""... Theme park operating income for Disney this year is expected to fall 27% to $1.16 billion, said Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias. By 2003, she said, the business could climb to $1.49 billion, depending on whether the U.S. goes to war with Iraq.

As you likely know, any large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you. These databases manage everything from user authentication, session management, site searching, etc. SourceForge.net is a database- dependent website. Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2, a powerful relational database by IBM. We are doing this because the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and 70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this growth. We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us the resources to make this transition successful. You can read the press release here: http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html How will this effect you? In the first phase, you won't see much difference other then the site will continue to grow and the SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth. In later phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of the databases advanced capabilities. Today our mail archives have be",0,1,authentic,0164.82c660c5e1f778f96a4e36ab9aec323b

My mother did not get to see this new film. She was always so proud of everything I did, cheering me on every day from the day where my memory begins. I had shown an early cut of the film to my friends last winter in my parent's living room, and mom would come in and out of the room, catching a scene here and there, saying, ""Boy, that's something, isn't it!""

Because when getting acl, it will allocate memory in KM_SLEEP, If the memory is tight, the process will call xfs_strategy, and may lock(XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)the same inode again. If between these two locks, another process try to lock the inode by XFS_ILOCK_EXCL, these two processes will be deadlock. As follows, A process get ea B process want lock ipA 1) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE) ..................... | | | | get acl 2) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_EXCL) | | | | memory tight | | xfs_stragegy | | 3)xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE) ............................ these two processes will be dead lock.

It is easy to enable the bytecode interpreter. 2. This noticeably improves rendering of non-antialiased text. 3. This noticeably *harms* rendering of antialiased text. Point #3 probably surprises the rest of you as much as it surprised me. Ever since turning on the bytecode interpreter, I've been bugged by a sense that the antialiased text in my GNOME2 applications just looked, well, wrong somehow. I finally took some comparison screen shots with and without the interpreter, and that made the difference crystal clear. Consider the two images attached below. The first, ""no-bytecodes.png"", shows some text rendered by a GNOME2 panel menu without the bytecode interpreter. Contrast this with the second, ""bytecodes.png"", taken with the bytecode interpreter enabled. When the bytecode interpreter is turned on, notice that several rendering anomalies appear: - Several letters are narrower, giving the whole run of text a more compressed feel. This is especially noticeable in ""R"" and ""o"". - The left side of the ""Q"" is painted in too light a shade of grey, causing it to drop out somewhat. ""C"", not in this sample, has the same problem. - ""Qu"" are set right up against each other, with insufficient whitespace between them. - ""M"" is distinctly asymmetric. - The enclosed loop of ""a"" looks muddy, as it is partially filled with grey. Contrast with ""a"" drawn without the bytecode interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop. Ick. Perhaps this is why Re",0,0,authentic,0133.d4a1ca8e0fcb12df4042bd8df916d69a

""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent shareholders from acting in their own interest."" ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in self-interest, but in self-destruction. ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers, existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.""

Systems Affected * Systems running PHP versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1 Overview A vulnerability has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could be used by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP and/or the web server. I. Description PHP is a popular scripting language in widespread use. For more information about PHP, see http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php The vulnerability occurs in the portion of PHP code responsible for handling file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a specially crafted POST request to the web server, an attacker can corrupt the internal data structures used by PHP. Specifically, an intruder can cause an improperly initialized memory structure to be freed. In most cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or the web server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to take advantage of this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server. You may be aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some implementations of malloc and free does not usually result in the execution of arbitrary code. However, because PHP utilizes its own memory management system, the implementation of malloc and free is irrelevant to this problem.

Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol. In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck, Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software. Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new opportun",0,1,authentic,0243.10129f7ac3cdf7aaf98bec60f1f3a2ef

Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam. It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws. The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and reported it out largely unchanged. It's not now scheduled for further action in the Senate. CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to more spam, not less. When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10. Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems with S.630: http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtml We're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that the entire Internet community can support. - ------",0,1,authentic,0197.68819fc91d34c82433074d7bd3127dcc

""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent shareholders from acting in their own interest."" ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in self-interest, but in self-destruction. ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers, existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us."" ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,"" said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding, regulations and making the market truly free."" ### ",0,1,authentic,0228.651a40f1c0b2ba19122eccebccbae788
