# Deep-Learn-Project
The objective of this project is to build and compare multiple Deep Learning models
for detecting spam emails using the SpamAssassin dataset.

## 📌 Background
Spam emails continue to evolve and are increasingly difficult to detect
using traditional rule-based or keyword-based approaches.
This project explores several Deep Learning architectures to improve
spam classification performance.

## 🧠 Models Implemented
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  
- Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)  
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)  
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  

## 📊 Dataset
**SpamAssassin Public Corpus**, consisting of:
- Spam
- Ham

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Tokenization & Padding  
4. Model Training (RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, CNN)  
5. Evaluation & Comparison  

## 🏆 Results
Based on experimental results, **BiLSTM and CNN** achieved the best performance,
with validation accuracy above 95% and stable loss convergence.
